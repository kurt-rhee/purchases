# What is this?
A set of purchases that I have made for reasons of:
- health
- environmentalism
- convenience

That I think might benefit others that share similar values to me.


## Motivation

Capitalism and Globalism have changed Ethics.  Classical ethics contends with mans relationship with God or man's relationship with other men.  As the world has increased in complexity, so has the sphere of ethics increased to include the new realities that we face as a species.

The newest reality we must face that has not quite made it's way into the American [overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) of ethics, is the ethics of scale.  It is undeniable at this point that small actions done at scale can have incredible effects on our collective experience on earth.  Littering one plastic bottle does nothing, but littering billions of them creates a [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/great-pacific-garbage-patch/) that harms our sea-life and sea-food.

If small actions can can compound to create calamities as large as climate change, ocean litter, antibiotic resistance, topsoil depletion, air pollution, they can also be compounded to fight those very things.  Global cooperation has lead to great reductions in ozone layer depletion, reductions in air pollution in some major cities, stabilization of some climate zones, plantings of new forests, etc.

## What I hope to achieve

However small:
- A greater awareness of consumerism's effect at scale
- A reduction in plastic consumption which reduces the profitability of oil companies and their lobbying potential
- Better health outcomes

## Caveats

This is all written from a place of privilege.  Alternative goods sometimes cost more money and not all people can participate in this effort.  This entire project is a practice in [Luxury Beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_belief).  I hope that by providing a market for these alternative products, they can eventually reach economies of scale that make them more accessible to people of all socio-economic strata.

## How to use this information

I am not religious, but the Christian Bible has a good line in it that summarizes my thoughts on how best to spread conscious consumerism.

"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."

So live well and spread this around to those who might find it useful.
